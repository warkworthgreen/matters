CRAG is a collaboration of community groups along the Coquet River who have joined together to help maintain and improve the Coquet River catchment. The overarching groups&rsquo;s <a href="https://coquetriveractiongroup.org/">website</a> provides information covering the overall project.
This page is dedicated to events specific to the Warkworth group.
This tidal part of the river and its tributaries present special challenges for Citizen Science, with brackish water, ground water and saltmarshes influencing test results. 

Events Planned for 2025:
<ul>
<li><strong>January 13th</strong>: 7pm at the Hermitage Inn. Presentation by Prof Mike Jeffries from Northumbria University. He has been involved in developing ponds and wetlands in the Druridge Bay area, creating an amazing range of Habitats.  From telling tales of the lives of water beetles through to how data collected from Druridge has been used in Global Scale analysis of threats from Climate Change. We are in for a treat! Fingers crossed on some home pond help too! <strong>N.B. We need to know numbers attending.</strong> Email wariversgroup@gmail.com if you wish to do so. 
<li><strong>February 3rd</strong>:  Jamie Day our lead for Data Analysis, will be coming to give us an overview of our areas results. We&rsquo;ll look at future planning ideas, possible research, resources and how we might go forward. To protect and work with our complicated, wonderful part of the Coquet. Email wariversgroup@gmail.com if you wish to attend. Venue to be arranged.  
<li><strong>March 6th at 7pm</strong> CRAG is teaming up with Northumberland Green Hub for an evening at Swarland Village Hall entitled <em>Space for Nature</em> â€“ a Developers Prospective. Suburban Drainage systems (SUDS) and Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) are important planning tools and have consequences way past the building stage for communities. This evening will give a different insight into SUDS and BNG opportunities and possibilities within planning. This will not deal with developments that are ongoing or under consideration, but it will show examples and ideas of how things may be improved. 
</ul>
<p>
During 2024 we gave talks to Parish Councils, Scout Groups, holding botany classes on invasive weeds, attending water festivals and meeting other citizen science programmes. If you are interested in being involved with the Warkworth group, get in touch with wariversgroup@gmail.com.
