CRAG is a collaboration of community groups along the Coquet River who have joined together to help maintain and improve the Coquet River catchment. <a href="https://coquetriveractiongroup.org/">CRAG&rsquo;s website</a> provides information covering the overall project, including a Blog giving <a href="https://coquetriveractiongroup.org/blogs-and-latest-news/">their latest news</a>.
<p>This web page is dedicated to the work specific to the Warkworth group.
This tidal part of the river and its tributaries present special challenges for Citizen Science, with brackish water, ground water and saltmarshes influencing test results. 
<p>
CRAG Little Shore Group has been formed to deliver a Community driven campaign working along side the Harbour Commission, aimed at gaining &quot;Bathing Water Status&quot; (BWS) for Little Shore, a popular bathing area, in Amble. 
BWS has its origins in the EU Bathing Water Directive first introduced in 1976. It provides protection by ensuring regular testing, investigation of pollution incidents and a plan to improve water quality. Warkworth and Amble Links beaches are already both designated BWS. 
<p>
Part of our campaign is talking to the community and encouraging the completion of a questionnaire looking at how often the beach is visited and used. The questionnaire will be available on line from the 13th May at coquetriveractiongroup.org , also in paper copy around Amble. We will be at the Puffin Festival on Saturday the 24th of May and we will be holding meetings during the bathing season.
<p>
Our regular Citizen Science Testing is continuing in both Warkworth and Amble for the next year. This will keep building knowledge of the River. New sites will be covered and new tests including Bacterial enterococci included. 
<p>
If you would like to join us either with the testing or with the campaign or just by joining the group and finding out what we are doing please contact wariversgroup@gmail.com.
