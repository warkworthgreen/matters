CRAG is a collaboration of community groups along the Coquet River who have joined together to help maintain and improve the Coquet River catchment. The overarching group&rsquo;s <a href="https://coquetriveractiongroup.org/">website</a> provides information covering the overall project. This includes a Blog giving <a href="https://coquetriveractiongroup.org/blogs-and-latest-news/">CRAG&rsquo;s latest news</a>.
<p>
This page is dedicated to events specific to the Warkworth group.
This tidal part of the river and its tributaries present special challenges for Citizen Science, with brackish water, ground water and saltmarshes influencing test results. 
<p>
This will be another interesting year with intensive river testing nearing completion in April. With around 40 sites from almost the Scottish Border at Barrowburn to our wonderful Estuary, this promises to bring understanding and knowledge for all. Groups have been joined throughout the year with some literally starting their data gathering now so the fullest picture will take time to emerge.
We will also be introducing some ideas for future protection of the river regions and hopefully get your thoughts and ideas along the way!

<ul>
<li><strong>February 3rd</strong>:  Jamie Day our lead for Data Analysis, will be coming to give us an overview of our areas results. We&rsquo;ll look at future planning ideas, possible research, resources and how we might go forward. To protect and work with our complicated, wonderful part of the Coquet. Email wariversgroup@gmail.com if you wish to attend. Venue to be arranged.  
<li><strong>March 6th at 7pm</strong> CRAG is teaming up with Northumberland Green Hub for an evening at Swarland Village Hall entitled <em>Space for Nature</em> â€“ a Developers Prospective. Suburban Drainage systems (SUDS) and Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) are important planning tools and have consequences way past the building stage for communities. This evening will give a different insight into SUDS and BNG opportunities and possibilities within planning. This will not deal with developments that are ongoing or under consideration, but it will show examples and ideas of how things may be improved. 
</ul>
<p>
Testing here will not stop in April, but it will change. We are cooperating with the EA to find the best ways to analyse samples in our estuary conditions. It&rsquo;s been incredibly interesting to begin to understand the limitations and scientific challenges of our area and I really hope many of you will join us to see how it&rsquo;s all coming along. 
<p>
During 2024 we gave talks to Parish Councils, Scout Groups, holding botany classes on invasive weeds, attending water festivals and meeting other citizen science programmes. If you are interested in being involved with the Warkworth group, get in touch with wariversgroup@gmail.com.
