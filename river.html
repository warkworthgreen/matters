CRAG is a collaboration of community groups along the Coquet River who have joined together to help maintain and improve the Coquet River catchment. The overarching group&rsquo;s <a href="https://coquetriveractiongroup.org/">website</a> provides information covering the overall project. This includes a Blog giving <a href="https://coquetriveractiongroup.org/blogs-and-latest-news/">CRAG&rsquo;s latest news</a>.
<p>
This page is dedicated to the work specific to the Warkworth group.
This tidal part of the river and its tributaries present special challenges for Citizen Science, with brackish water, ground water and saltmarshes influencing test results. 
<p>
This will be another interesting year with intensive river testing nearing completion in April. With around 40 sites from almost the Scottish Border at Barrowburn to our wonderful Estuary, this promises to bring understanding and knowledge for all. Groups have been joined throughout the year with some literally starting their data gathering now so the fullest picture will take time to emerge.
We will also be introducing some ideas for future protection of the river regions and hopefully get your thoughts and ideas along the way!

<p>
Testing here will not stop in April, but it will change. We are cooperating with the EA to find the best ways to analyse samples in our estuary conditions. It&rsquo;s been incredibly interesting to begin to understand the limitations and scientific challenges of our area and we really hope many of you will join us to see how it&rsquo;s all coming along.
