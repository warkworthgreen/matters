Coquet River Action Group now has insurance for all its volunteer activities which is great news as it enables us to organise kick testing, school outings, invasive weeds teams, spot testing, and many other things over the coming years.
<p>
The tidal part of the river and its tributaries present special challenges for Citizen Science, with brackish water, ground water and saltmarshes influencing results. CRAG are working with The Rivers Trust and the Environment Agency to get the most of our testing and develop strategies and ideas to take us forward. Our Amble and Warkworth group will host a meeting early next year with Jamie Day who will be feeding back on the results so far and ideas for us to think about for next year. It&rsquo;s for us as a group to decide the how, when and what we plan and organise!
<p>
During 2024 we gave talks to Parish Councils, Scout Groups, holding botany classes on invasive weeds, attending water festivals and meeting other citizen science programmes. If you are interested in being involved, that’s great, get in touch with wariversgroup@gmail.com. CRAG also have a great  <a href="coquetriveractiongroup.org">website</a>. 
<p>
Events Planned for 2025
<ul>
<li>Warkworth Water Works (WWW) .We have tours of WWW for our members. 10 people each tour. If you&rsquo;d like to go send an email to wariversgroup@gmail.com . All interested please send your name in. It&rsquo;s  a great opportunity, and very interesting. Not to be missed.
<li>On January 13th   2025, 7pm we will be joined at the Hermitage Inn by Prof Mike Jeffries from Northumbria University.  He has been involved in developing ponds and wetlands in the Druridge Bay area, creating an amazing range of Habitats.  From telling tales of the lives of water beetles through to how data collected from Druridge has been used in Global Scale analysis of threats from Climate Change. We are in for a treat! Fingers crossed on some home pond help too! Very important RSVP so I can have numbers. If over 30 we have another venue we can use
<li>On February 3rd  Jamie Day our lead for Data Analysis, will be coming to give us an overview of our areas results. We’ll look at future planning ideas, possible research, resources and how we might go forward. To protect and work with our complicated, wonderful part of the Coquet. RSVP please. Venue has yet to be arranged.  
<li>Date - TBA CRAG is teaming up with Northumberland Green Hub for an evening at Swarland Village Hall entitled Space for Nature – a Developers Prospective. Suburban Drainage systems (SUDS) and Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) are very important planning tools and have consequences way past the building stage for communities. This evening will give a different insight into SUDS and BNG opportunities and possibilities within planning. A very difficult area to understand and for many of us.  This will not deal with developments that are ongoing or under consideration in this area but it will show examples and ideas of how things may be improved and add positively to communities. There will be time to discuss and look at examples and ideas.
</ul>
There are opportunities within CRAG and WA Rivers to join in the Citizen Science work. We are looking for people to be part of the Data Analysis and Input: database building,  look at GIS Training and ideas: communication,: planning events, invasive weed removal, working with youth groups and schools and lots more . Please get in touch if you&rsquo;d like to be involved. CRAG@coquetriveractiongroup.org
