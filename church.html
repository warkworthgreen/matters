Care for all aspects of God&rsquo;s creation is central to Christian witness in all communities.
Together with the wider Alnwick Deanery, St Lawrence Warkworth is participating in A Rocha UK&rsquo;s
&quot;Eco Church&quot; scheme which provides a framework for working towards greater environmental
sustainability. Practical action is supported by a Survey addressing five key areas of church life:
Worship and Teaching; Buildings and Energy; Land and Nature; Community and Global
Engagement; and Lifestyle.
<p>
Building on small steps in each of these five areas area, churches are invited to work towards
bronze, silver and gold awards. St Lawrence gained the bronze award in the summer of 2024,
strengthened by such steps as starting to use recycled paper for pew sheets, service sheets and
toilet paper; encouraging lifestyle adjustments through weekly eco-tips on the weekly pewsheet;
and creation themed worship at parish and deanery level. We are also collaborating with
Warkworth Green Matters in managing the north churchyard to increase habitats and biodiversity,
including leaving some areas unmown, and planting native bulbs.
<p>
The parish is now on the journey towards a silver award. We are always on the look-out for people
who would like to help us. Please contact Gilly Maude ( revgilly.pilgrim@gmail.com or 07527
169016) for further information or to offer help.
